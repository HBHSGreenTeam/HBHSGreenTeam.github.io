						<h3>Recycling</h3>
						<p>There have been a few attempts at recycling on HBHS grounds over the years but none have been successful.  Finally, the HBHS Green Team has teamed up with Rainbow Environmental Services to foster a co-mingled recycling system that helps fund our sustainability program.  We now have a recycling tub in every classroom as well as recycling barrels around campus where we collect aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles, paper, cardboard, and other co-mingled recyclable items.  The students collect the tubs once a week, sort the materials, and weigh them.  While this recycling takes up a large part of a 1 1/2 hour block period, it is well worth it.  Last year in 2012, HBHS recycled over 40,000 pounds of paper and cardboard, as well as over 5,000 pounds of plastic and aluminum bottles and cans.>/p>

								<h3>The Recycling Center</h3>
								<p>The students are currently working on improving our recycling efforts by creating a new recycling center on campus.  This will be a new facility where we can sort, weigh, and store material as well as serve as a collection center for the community to drop off recyclable materials such as newspapers, plastic bottles, and aluminum cans.  Parents can now help us raise funds for the school by dropping of their recyclables to us rather than throwing them in the trash.  The only 3 items we are looking for from the community is:
 
<br>1) Clean, dry, newspapers
<br>2) Aluminum cans
<br>3) Plastic bottles</p>
