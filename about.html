						<h3>HBHS Green Team</h3>
						<p>The HBHS Green Team sustainability program was started in 2009 by social studies teacher Greg Goran.  What began as a student club to generate interest in recycling around school and learning about urban agriculture has now grown into a complete sustainability program that includes a student body club, elective classes, an organic garden, a school wide recycling program, and an entrepreneurial component.  Students are now not only learning about a variety of environmental issues facing the world, but are learning how to go out there and make positive changes in their community to address some of these issues. <br><br> What is exciting about the program is it supports itself through revenues generated from recycling as well as from the organic produce grown in the garden, not costing the school district or tax payer a single dollar.  In fact, the program not only supports itself, but it saves the district money by reducing its waste stream through recycling and helps conserves energy and water through conducting energy audits on campus.  Students not only learn about the positive effects of organic agriculture, recycling, energy auditing, and renewable energy, but also how to make connections with local businesses and organizations that can guide them towards environmental college and career choices.</p>
